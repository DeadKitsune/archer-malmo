			<div class="banner-text">The image of the board made me laugh. It was a real big funny and honestly it’s the type of environment I’m looking for in a company. It’s kind of idolized in my mind to work at a company like Rooster Teeth but that’s dream and environment to me is key.</div>

			<div class="banner-text">Here we see the wild Ping Pong Veteran in his natural habitat, waiting to serve and win the finals of the Ping Pong World Championship. Honestly, I found the fact that they have a Ping Pong table funny in may respects and rights and it was fun to hear that they use the table during breaks. I hope I get a company like that or so. </div>

It was like a college lecture but the brightness in our eyes says we were happy to be there or at least, I was. Griffin, on the other hand, looked dead inside per usual. </div>

		<p>The trip to Archer Malmo was a very quiet one. It was a very tranquil trip that lead us to a very informative place. To say the least, as much as it was informative, it was kinda bland. The technical works that went into the process of being a web designer or working in the field wasn’t as glamorous as I wanted it to be. I knew for a fact that it wasn’t going to be the best sorta experience but regardless it was nice to know what I would be getting into. Most of the things we learned were common knowledge but the experience that was there was unknown territory to me. Looking at it, most of the job is spent looking at a screen and figuring out which is the best way to deal with a problem and trying to solve it. There are the customer’s stuff and it was very informative experience to say the least.

		<img id="cookout" src="cookout.jpg">
		<span class="tooltiptext">
			Cookout: The End.
			<br>
			Or so it would seem. Honestly, cookout had to be my favorite part of the entire trip and it was all due to the fact that I’ve never been to cookout before. I think I got the big double burger with chicken nuggets and some fries. It was honestly heaven and I wanna go back there again to eat since it was so good. Comparing it to other fast food restaurants would be an injustice to the fast food place itself. Their milkshakes are to die for as well and my lord is there anything not to die for there. Their main selling point is the sauce. The sweet sweet cookout sauce has to be the greatest thing about that place. Period. Besides that, I’ve never felt so full after eating there.
